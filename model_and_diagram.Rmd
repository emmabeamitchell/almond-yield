In the function we've created, we took the climate data that was given to us and filtered the data to just January and February, as the equation in the paper stated. Our function takes the daily data and mutates it so the values are per month. We then input these new variables into the given equation and set the function to result in the three desired findings: minimum yield, mean yield, and maximum yield. This follows the conceptual model pictured above.
